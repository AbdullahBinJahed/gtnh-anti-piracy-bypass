  <h1>GTNH anti piracy bypass</h1>
  <p>For some stupid reason, the devs of gtnh modpack is a Microsoft bootlicker. 
    They think the poor Minecraft devs can't feed their children or something. Anyway here's how to bypass 
    the anti piracy bs: <br>
    usually I'd give credit to the nice fellow who told me about it but they may ban him from subreddit or 
    something so I'm not giving credit, sorry.
    <br><br>
    1. First go to config/hodgepodge.cfg from serverside and change <br><br>
    <span>fixNetHandlerLoginServerOfflineMode=true</span> <br>
    to <br>
    <span>fixNetHandlerLoginServerOfflineMode=false</span> <br><br>
    do it from both server and client side. <br><br>
    now I ran into another issue. which is: <br>
    <img src="./assets/err.png" alt="null pointer exc, can't read recipe because v is null"> <br>
    simply remove the <span>Dynamic Lightning</span> mod from your client and this problem should go away.
    </p>
